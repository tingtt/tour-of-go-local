## Where to Go from here...

You can get started by [installing Go](/doc/install/).

Once you have Go installed, the [Go Documentation](/doc/) is a great place to continue. It contains references, tutorials, videos, and more.

To learn how to organize and work with Go code, read [How to Write Go Code](/doc/code).

If you need help with the standard library, see the [package reference](/pkg/). For help with the language itself, you might be surprised to find the [Language Spec](/ref/spec) is quite readable.

To further explore Go's concurrency model, watch [Go Concurrency Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6kdp27TYZs) ([slides](/talks/2012/concurrency.slide)) and [Advanced Go Concurrency Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDDwwePbDtw) ([slides](/talks/2013/advconc.slide)) and read the [Share Memory by Communicating](/doc/codewalk/sharemem/) codewalk.

To get started writing web applications, watch [A simple programming environment](https://vimeo.com/53221558) ([slides](/talks/2012/simple.slide)) and read the [Writing Web Applications](/doc/articles/wiki/) tutorial.

The [First Class Functions in Go](/doc/codewalk/functions/) codewalk gives an interesting perspective on Go's function types.

The [Go Blog](/blog/) has a large archive of informative Go articles.
