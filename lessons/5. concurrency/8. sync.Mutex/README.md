## sync.Mutex

We've seen how channels are great for communication among goroutines.

But what if we don't need communication? What if we just want to make sure only one goroutine can access a variable at a time to avoid conflicts?

This concept is called *mutual exclusion*, and the conventional name for the data structure that provides it is *mutex*.

Go's standard library provides mutual exclusion with [`sync.Mutex`](/pkg/sync/#Mutex) and its two methods:

- `Lock`
- `Unlock`

We can define a block of code to be executed in mutual exclusion by surrounding it with a call to `Lock` and `Unlock` as shown on the `Inc` method.

We can also use `defer` to ensure the mutex will be unlocked as in the `Value` method.
