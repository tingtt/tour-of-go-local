## Pointers

Go has pointers. A pointer holds the memory address of a value.

The type `*T` is a pointer to a `T` value. Its zero value is `nil`.

```
var p *int
```

The `&` operator generates a pointer to its operand.

```
i := 42
p = &i
```

The `*` operator denotes the pointer's underlying value.

```
fmt.Println(*p) // read i through the pointer p
*p = 21         // set i through the pointer p
```

This is known as "dereferencing" or "indirecting".

Unlike C, Go has no pointer arithmetic.
