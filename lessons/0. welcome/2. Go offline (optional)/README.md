## Go offline (optional)

This tour is also available as a stand-alone program that you can use without access to the internet. It builds and runs the code samples on your own machine.

To run the tour locally, you'll need to first [install Go](/doc/install) and then run:

```
go install golang.org/x/website/tour@latest
```

This will place a `tour` binary in your [GOPATH](/cmd/go/#hdr-GOPATH_and_Modules)'s `bin` directory. When you run the tour program, it will open a web browser displaying your local version of the tour.

Of course, you can continue to take the tour through this web site.
